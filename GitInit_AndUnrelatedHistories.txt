Short Hand
git init
git remote add origin <ssh>
git add <filename>
git commit -m "<write message>"
git push origin master -- resulted in "error: failed to push some refs to" (This was because Readme.txt was in GitRepo and in localRepo) 
We moved Readme.txt out of local folder
git pull -- resulted in "There is no tracking information for the current branch."
git pull origin master  --resulted in "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin master
